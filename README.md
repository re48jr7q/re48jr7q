- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @re48jr7q, my name is Erwin.
- 
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in C++, i just started learning. When I looked at C++
for the first time I was immediately attracted to it. 
Hopefully i get the swing off it... 
I'm Dutch, so my English syntax is not very good.
I am currently in the process of learning Python.
I uploaded my first project to GitHub on 10-05-2025.
